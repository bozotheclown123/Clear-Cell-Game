# Clear Cell Game

The game board is a grid of colorful squares we are calling "cells". The goal is to clear as many cells as possible before 
the colorful cells reach the bottom row. When the user clicks on a cell it will be cleared, along with adjacent cells that have the same color. 
(This includes cells directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and each of the four diagonally adjacent squares.) 
If an entire row of cells is cleared, the row will be removed (collapsed) so that all of the rows beneath shift upward.

The game will keep track of the player's score. The player gets one point for each cell that is cleared.
